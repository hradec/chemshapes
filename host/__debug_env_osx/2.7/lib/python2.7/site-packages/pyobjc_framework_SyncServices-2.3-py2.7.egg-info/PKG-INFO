Description:  
        Wrappers for the "SyncServices" framework on MacOSX. 
        
        Sync Services is a framework containing all the components you need 
        to sync your applications and devices. If your application uses 
        Sync Services, user data can be synced with other applications and 
        devices on the same computer, or other computers over the network via 
        MobileMe.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
